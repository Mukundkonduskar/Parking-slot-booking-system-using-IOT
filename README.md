• Our system uses IOT devices like Arduino UNO and IR motion sensors to detect the vehicle, you will
be able book slot on our website and see whether the slot is empty, booked or occupied.
• This IoT based online parking systems is designed to replace the traditional parking infrastructure with a more
advanced and efficient solution based on the Internet of Things (IoT). These systems not only facilitate parking
slot booking but also offer the ability to detect the presence of a car in parking lots, leading the driver to an
available and suitable location for their vehicle. This innovation leverages a combination of technologies to make
parking smarter and more user-friendly, benefiting both drivers and urban planners. It incorporates various
components such as infrared (IR) sensors, microcontrollers, and electronic devices to create a comprehensive
and seamless parking experience.
• The process begins with the user's interaction with the online platform. Users can conveniently check the
availability of parking slots online, ensuring that they have a clear understanding of the parking situation even
before arriving at their destination. This step alone saves valuable time and reduces the stress associated with
finding a parking space. Simultaneously, the microcontroller, the core component of the system, works tirelessly
behind the scenes to continuously monitor and update the availability of parking slots. This real-time data is
then made accessible across the Internet, ensuring that drivers are always well-informed about their parking
options.
